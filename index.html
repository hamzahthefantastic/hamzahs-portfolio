            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>"Hi, my name is Hamzah Al-Emad and I'm a comedy content creator and TikTok personality. I'm known for posting
                point-of-view style videos on my self titled account and have been fortunate enough to amass over 1.4
                million fans on the platform. Before I went viral with one of my earliest videos, I was born in Yemen
                and moved to the United States when I was only eight months old. Later, I relocated to Canada at 17
                years old. My younger brother has even made appearances on my TikTok account. In addition to my TikTok
                fame, I've also launched a YouTube channel and have streamed on the popular 4freakshow Twitch channel
                alongside Chase Rutherford, yodelinghaley, and Claire Drake. On December 26, 2019, I even posted a video
                where I imitated Jacob Sartorius. Thanks for stopping by and getting to know a little bit about me!"</p>
